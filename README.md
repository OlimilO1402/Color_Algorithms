Project started around mid.2017.  
This is a collection of different algorithms for encoding color-values.  
RGB, RGB-float, CMYK, HSL, HSV, XYZ, CieLab, YCbCr and alpha channel for transparency.  
all X11-knowncolors, all RAL-classic-colors, all Systemcolors and all Munsell-colors are included.  
How to select a color from your screen:
* click the button on/off and move your mouse across the screen (don't click)  
* now pressing the enter-key on your keyboard activates the on/off-button again and gets the color selected.  
* you get the nearest x11-knowncolor, ral-color or munsell-color below the drop-down-boxes
