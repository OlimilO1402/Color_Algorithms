Project started around mid.2017.  
This is a collection of different algorithms for encoding color-values.  
RGB, RGB-float, CMYK, HSL, HSV, XYZ and alpha channel for transparency.  
X11-knowncolors, RAL-classic colors and Systemcolors are also included.  
How to select a color from your screen:
* click the button on/off and move your mouse over the screen (don't click)  
* now pressing the enter-key on your keyboard activates the on/off-button again and gets the color selected.
